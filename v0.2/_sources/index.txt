XDress
==================================
XDress is an automatic wrapper generator for C/C++ written in pure Python. Currently,
xdress may generate Python bindings (via Cython) for C++ classes & functions 
and in-memory wrappers for C++ standard library containers (sets, vectors, maps).  
In the future, other tools and bindings will be supported.  

The main enabling feature of xdress is a dynamic type system that was designed with 
the purpose of API generation in mind.

Installation
============
Since xdress is pure Python code, the ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` may be used
to grab and install the code::

    $ pip install xdress

    $ easy_install xdress


The source code repository for xdress may be found at the 
`GitHub project site <http://github.com/scopatz/xdress>`_.
You may simply clone the development branch using git::

    git clone git://github.com/scopatz/xdress.git

Examples of Use
===============
To see examples of xdress in action (and sample run control files), here are a
few places to look:

* `xdress/tests <https://github.com/scopatz/xdress/tree/master/tests>`_: This is 
  a fully functioning sample project which uses xdress locally (no install needed).
* `PyNE <http://pynesim.org/>`_: This uses xdress to generate STL container wrappers.
* `Bright <http://bright-dev.github.com/>`_: This uses xdress to automatically
  wrap a suite of interacting C++ class.  This was the motivating use case for the
  xdress project.
